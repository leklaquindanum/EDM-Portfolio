# MIDTERM LAB TASK 2
## Scenario:
Company X would like to extract some useful information from the UnclenedDSJObs csv taken
from a Job Posting site available in Kaggle. There are a lot of columns available but focus only
on generating insights that will answer the following questions:
1. Which Job Roles pay the highest and least.
2. What size companies pay the best.
3. Where Job Roles or Job Titles pay the best and least in a specific state.
