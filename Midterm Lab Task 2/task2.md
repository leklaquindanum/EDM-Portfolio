# MIDTERM LAB TASK 2
This portfolio demonstrates how to clean and prepare data using Power Query. The dataset is made up of several related tables, with cleaning techniques used to improve data quality and consistency before analysis.

## 1. Task Description:
Company X would like to extract some useful information from the UnclenedDSJObs csv taken
from a Job Posting site available in Kaggle. There are a lot of columns available but focus only
on generating insights that will answer the following questions:
1. Which Job Roles pay the highest and least.
2. What size companies pay the best.
3. Where Job Roles or Job Titles pay the best and least in a specific state.
