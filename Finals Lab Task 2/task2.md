# FINALS LAB TASK 2
This Lab TaskÂ involves writing SQL queries, creating table structures, and developing relational schemas or ER diagrams.  To demonstrate the database's construction, the portfolio will also contain SQL copies of the database and table structures.

## Instructions

1. Create the *student table*:
- Define **username** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max), and as PRIMARY KEY.

2. Create the *assignment table*:
- Define **shortname** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max), and as PRIMARY KEY.
- Define **due_date** as DATE, and make it NOT NULL.
- Define **url** as VARCHAR (255 characters at max), and make it optional (can be either NULL or NOT NULL).

3. Create the *submission table*:
- Define **username** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max).
- Define **shortname** as VARCHAR (50 characters at max).
- Define **version** as INTEGER.
- Define **submit_date** as DATE, and make it NOT NULL.
